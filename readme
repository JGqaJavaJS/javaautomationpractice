Project created as a technical sandbox to practice Java
and test automation framework design concepts for interview preparation.
Each block contains explanation.
-------------------------------------------
Java 11 ensures stable parallel execution, improved memory management,
and faster test runtime in CI/CD pipelines.
Optimized for Docker containers and fully compatible with modern testing
frameworks like Selenium 4 and RestAssured.

SELENIUM
1. add dependencies in pom.xml and src/test/resources/testng.xml example
2. UI tests use https://the-internet.herokuapp.com;
browser setup is implemented in
src/test/java/seleniumtests/browserfactory/BrowserFactory.java,
and a temporary test for verifying test execution is located at
src/test/java/seleniumtests/tests/TestsToDelete.java.
and test running with
mvn test -Dbrowser=firefox -Dheadless=true
in src/test/resources/testng.xml
